Councils prepare to set tax rises  Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.
Authorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%.
On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms."
