Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants.
Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.

Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected.
Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.
There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard.
Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.
