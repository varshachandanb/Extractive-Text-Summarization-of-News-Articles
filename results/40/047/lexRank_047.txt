"However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here."
"We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.
Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor.
Mr Wallace said: "Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain.
Student 'fee factor' played down  A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.
However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out.
Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700.
Fears had been expressed that a flood of "fee refugees" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to Â£3,000 a year being introduced in England.
