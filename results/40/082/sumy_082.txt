A "taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution.Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw.Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was "fully justified"."Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?," he asked.The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand.The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade.Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a "level playing field" on immigration and asylum controls.For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy.Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre.
