The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.
The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.
The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.
He told BBC News: "We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well.
He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.
But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.
Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.
The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: "It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.
Tuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest.
From 2006 upfront tuition fees in England would be removed, with grants for the less well off.
