The tone of the campaign, said Mr Milburn, would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people.
"In contrast Charles Kennedy will feature prominently in the Liberal Democrat campaign right across the country."
The general election is widely expected next May and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations.
Mr Milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the Cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy.
Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell is also returning to advise Labour on media strategy and campaigning.
Mr Milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether David Blunkett would have a prominent role in the election.
Labour battle plan 'hides Blair'  The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being "terrified" of scrutiny after Labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election.

He promised "the most positive and upbeat election campaign Labour has ever run".
But Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said Labour's plans showed Mr Blair was "terrified of facing proper scrutiny".
