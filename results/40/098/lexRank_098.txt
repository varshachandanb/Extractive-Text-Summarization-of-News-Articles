Ministers deny care sums 'wrong'  Ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.
SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.
But Ms Brankin told BBC Radio Scotland: "We don't think we got our sums wrong.
But the Scottish National Party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy.
She said: "Serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the Scottish Executive.
"We need to know that the money is there, not just for this year or next year, but into the future so that older people, and those who are looking forward to older age, can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met."
