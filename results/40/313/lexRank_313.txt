A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study.
Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55.
Age Concern says the over-55s are "united around" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on.
The report was welcomed by Conservative shadow pensions secretary David Willetts.
Parties warned over 'grey vote'  Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.
Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.
Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.
He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to "support us all in an ageing society".
