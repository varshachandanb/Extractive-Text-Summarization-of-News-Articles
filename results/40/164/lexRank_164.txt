McConnell details Scots wave toll  At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.
The figures came out during a statement by Jack McConnell to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday.
He formally expressed Scotland's sympathy for the victims of the Indian Ocean tidal wave which killed 150,000.
Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort.
He said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.
Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better.
