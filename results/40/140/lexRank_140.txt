UK helps raped Rwandan women  Britain is to give a Â£4m grant to help women survivors of the Rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with HIV/Aids.
An estimated 25,000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide.
About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic Hutu leader.
The five-year Department for International Development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.
The plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time.
