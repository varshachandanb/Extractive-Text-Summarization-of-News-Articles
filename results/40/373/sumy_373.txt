Speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances.Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.Mr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: "One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque.The 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit.Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a "crucial test" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain.EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end.Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%."We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency.UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was "set in stone" and there was no reason to negotiate about it.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution.Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections.There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.Britain's low unemployment meant there was less "neurosis" about people coming from eastern European countries."In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in," he said.
