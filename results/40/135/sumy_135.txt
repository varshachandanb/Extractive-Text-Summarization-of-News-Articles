Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give "hundreds of millions" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt.The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing.Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel."I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives."Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in "intensive talks" with other G8 finance ministers.Tory leader Michael Howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been "playing catch-up" with public donations.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week.During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday.On Friday, he will visit the Thai beach resort of Phuket, where British families are still searching for relatives.International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka.
