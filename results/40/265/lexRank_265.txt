"Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."
"Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police."
Tories unveil quango blitz plans  Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.
Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than Â£4.3bn.
Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities.
Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.
The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing.
Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government.
