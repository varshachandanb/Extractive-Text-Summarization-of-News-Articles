The DCA had "failed" to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a "lack of consistent leadership", the MPs found.
Committee chairman Alan Beith said: "The DCA has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.
'Few ready' for information act  Thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the Freedom of Information Act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say MPs.
From next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from Whitehall departments to doctors' surgeries.
But an all-party committee said it was "not confident" many would be ready.
It blamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs for a "lack of consistent leadership".
