Some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said.
The TUC has called on the government to appoint "roving" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.
It said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 "safety whistleblowers" had lost their jobs since 1999.
The Health and Safety Executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer.
The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.
Safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation.
