However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans.
Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: "People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of Â£35bn worth of savings.
Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.
The bulk of the Â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said.
"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today."
Mr Howard said: "All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less."
However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: "None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is Â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard."
"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities."
Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election.
"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme.
The Â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added.
