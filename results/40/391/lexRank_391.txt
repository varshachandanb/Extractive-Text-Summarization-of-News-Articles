'EU referendum could cost Â£80m'  It could cost Â£80m to run a UK referendum on the European constitution, ministers have revealed.
In a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election.
Mr Leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous British referendum, held 30 years ago.
Ministers say the constitution would make the European Union work better but critics fear creating a "super state".
