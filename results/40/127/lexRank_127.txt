Brown to outline presidency goals  Next year will be "make or break" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.
The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005.
They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations.
Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.
He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria.
The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries."
His proposals were effectively a new "Marshall Plan" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year.
Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued.
The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.
Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.
