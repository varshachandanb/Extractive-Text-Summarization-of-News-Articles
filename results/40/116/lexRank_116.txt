And responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system.
The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.
But he said replacing the controversial CSA would be "the nuclear option".
A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks.
Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: "If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced."
The committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed.
It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was "fit for purpose", describing it as "a failing organisation" and "in crisis" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations.
The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the "abandonment option", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.
"But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work."
