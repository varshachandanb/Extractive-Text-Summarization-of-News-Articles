The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News of his personal response to the move.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.But in 1946 Winston Churchill told us - from the Baltic to the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across Europe.Josef Stalin triggered the Cold War, with the Berlin blockade in 1948.The Cold War lasted 43 years, but we remained a parliamentary democracy.Al Fatah, Black September, Red Brigades, but most of all for us the IRA and the INLA.Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.Evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes , and one judge, no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.An interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but I suggest we move one step further.Our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart.Why not try a foreign policy of compassion, it can only enhance our democracy, and share our freedom.We really can't deal with terrorism by turning Britain into a fascist state.Our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain gets away.Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).When ID cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act, and will be readily available to people like GCHQ, with no control by the person whose ID is being checked.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.As somebody of Chinese origin, I can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life.We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of British Citizens at home or abroad.The people have the right to know and the BBC's role is to Inform, Educate and Entertain...Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.In the end, the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy.Ricin, for example, is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.We will have lost the precious freedom which Bush and Blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.Mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in Northern Ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young Catholics to join the IRA.Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?The rise of surveillance cameras, ID cards, the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times, this is the stuff of nightmares.Add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the Home Secretary, and I genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.Experienced Judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times.It is no longer to our armed forces, as the Soviet threat in the Eastern bloc was.At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.I'd say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major UK target is a "When" not an "If" probability.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.At what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the British Isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly?I think that the attack on Iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.Frederic Forsythe's comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole, and Britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear.The government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it.It's all very well criticising that policy, but if Mr Forsythe can't draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative, I say 'So what?'This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.The rule of law must prevail, civil liberties are worth defending.By introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.Totalitarianism always requires an outside threat, justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.There is over reaction to and the negative influence of the US President's interpretation of democracy and freedom.He uses the same arguments that were current before the WWII, the Wars to "liberate" Iraq, Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'Has he forgotten about shoot to kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion with loyalist death squads etc?We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.Whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism.Who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years?It smacks to me of the methods of Nazi Germany, Stalin's Russia, Ceausescu's Romania - the list goes on.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.Our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it.If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.If individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.Mr Forsyth links "Islamic fundamentalism" to the new "threat".It should be pointed out that a Muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the Qur'aan and the teachings of the last Prophet Muhammad is an Islamic Fundamentalist.This person does not commit suicide in any shape or form, nor does she/he kill innocent women, men and children.The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new "threat" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam.I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.During the IRA bombings there were massive explosions in Canary Wharf, to the right of where I write this, and also to the left in the City of London.Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq.Even when England was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like.We have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including ID cards, which Winston Churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number).Hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.What can I add to Mr. Forsyth's eloquently put arguments... except applause!
