Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris.
The mountainous region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the "spirit of cooperation" in achieving the breakthrough.
Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process.
The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday.
In a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad "will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades".
