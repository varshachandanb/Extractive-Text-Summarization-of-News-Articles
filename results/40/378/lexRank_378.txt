But the government is continuing to insist that "control orders" must be issued by the home secretary.
Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: "We are being advised by the police and the security services... "What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt.
"And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances."
But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in "rushing" anti-terrorism legislation.
On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders.
Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue.
Blair defends terror law changes  The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying "several hundred" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.
The government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes.
But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the "basic principle".
