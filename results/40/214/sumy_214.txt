Deaths in custody have reached "shocking" levels, a committee of MPs and peers has warned.The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals.Increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said.The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered.The committee also highlighted "deeply worrying" cases of children and young people taking their own lives.It picked out the case of Joseph Scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in Stoke Heath Young Offender Institution in March 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry.It revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times.Even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order.
