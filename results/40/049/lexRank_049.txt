He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors.
Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as "deeply flawed" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.
The Home Office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.
The Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett's resignation was a "good opportunity" to question whether the legislation was necessary.
But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.
"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society," he said.
Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been "significantly influenced" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.
The issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted.
"Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?"
