MPs assess Scots fishing industry  A group of MPs are on a two-day fact-finding mission to Scotland to gather evidence for a report into the UK's fishing industry.
Members of Westminster's environment, food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors.
They will also talk to Fisheries Minister Ross Finnie and scientists.
MPs are deciding whether to recommend a new system of "community quotas" to conserve fish stocks.
