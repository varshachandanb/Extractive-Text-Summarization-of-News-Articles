Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday.Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments.He said: "It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.The RAC welcomed the news, calling it an "early Christmas present" for motorists.Environmental group Transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists."We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action," said a spokesman.
