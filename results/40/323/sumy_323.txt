Voters' "pent up passion" could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election, Charles Kennedy has said.The Liberal Democrat leader predicted concerns over Iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign.He, like Mr Kennedy, pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the Iraq war.Mr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were "more interested in politics than ever before".The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.This has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting.
