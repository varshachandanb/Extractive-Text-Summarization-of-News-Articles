The Conservative Party would deal "sympathetically" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said. Dr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for "vindictiveness" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. A jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987. "I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell. "Tory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial.
