Chancellor rallies Labour voters  Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the "stakes are too high" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.
The chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a "clear and fundamental" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts.
He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win.
The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.
To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country.
Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: "I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, Â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.
"Never again Tory boom and bust.
"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of Â£35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 Â£60bn more."
Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.
He also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty.
And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder.
