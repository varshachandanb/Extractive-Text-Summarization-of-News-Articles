The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use "reasonable force".
But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of "excessive and gratuitous" force.
Burglar defence guidelines issued  Householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting "honestly and instinctively", new guidelines say.
The law also protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon.
The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law.
Doing what you "honestly and instinctively" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.
And the law protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves.
The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use "grossly disproportionate" force.
