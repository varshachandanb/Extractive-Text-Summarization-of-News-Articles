The Conservatives would stand up for the "forgotten majority", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people.Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue "down the path of ever rising taxes".He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall "bureaucrats"."The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder," he says.Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said.He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour.Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of "launching Thatcherism in instalments" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families.Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September."The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust," he said.
