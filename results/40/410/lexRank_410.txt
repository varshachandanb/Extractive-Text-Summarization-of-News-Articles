Sayeed to stand down as Tory MP  Tory MP Jonathan Sayeed is to stand down on the grounds of ill health.
The Mid-Bedfordshire MP had denied a claim that he was paid for guiding visitors around the Palace of Westminster.
Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP's resignation, it has been announced.
After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.
But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest.
The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament.
