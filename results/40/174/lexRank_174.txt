She said questions must be answered about his escape, if the public is to be reassured about safety.
The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave.
She added: "I have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact.
BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation.
He said: "We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs.
Strathclyde Police asked anyone who spots Ferguson to contact Sergeant Keith McDonald on  .
The Scottish Executive said ministers would be notified but it would "not be common practice" to sign approval.
Michael Ferguson, 36, escaped after being allowed out of the high-security Carstairs unit.
An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report.
Ministerial responsibility for Carstairs rests with Rhona Brankin, the deputy health minister.
Ms Brankin said: "The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this."
Police are still searching for Ferguson, who failed to return after a trip to East Kilbride on Monday.
The Scottish National Party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers.
