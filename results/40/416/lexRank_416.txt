Mr Howard's seat is at the top of the Liberal Democrats' list.
In 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907.
Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said.
He said it was "nothing personal" but that "very many of the prominent Conservatives" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.
Asked if this amounted to the party's much vaunted "decapitation strategy" Lord Rennard said it was not a term he had ever used.
But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives.
