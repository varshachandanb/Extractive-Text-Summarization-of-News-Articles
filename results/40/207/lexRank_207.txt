February poll claim 'speculation'  Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as "idle speculation" by Downing Street.
A spokesman said he had "no idea" where the reports in the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph had come from.
The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a "Baghdad bounce" following successful Iraq elections in January.
A British general election was last held in February in 1974.
In that election, Edward Heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the Liberals.
