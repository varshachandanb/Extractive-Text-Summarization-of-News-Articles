Howard attacks 'pay later' Budget  Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed Gordon Brown's Budget as "vote now, pay later" spending plans.
Mr Brown liked to rattle off "magical balances conjured out of thin air" in a bid to convince people there was no "black hole" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said.
The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said.
Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was Â£300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said.
Everyone could see the chancellor's "sweeteners", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said.
Labour's "faltering election campaign" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.
