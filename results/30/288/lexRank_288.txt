New UKIP defection to 'Veritas'  The UK Independence Party has lost one of its two London Assembly members to Robert Kilroy-Silk's new political party, expected to launch on Wednesday.
Sources close to Mr Hockney said around eight other members of London UKIP were also planning to jump ship.
UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.
Damian Hockney said ex-chatshow host Mr Kilroy-Silk would "deliver better" as the leader of a eurosceptic party.
He said Mr Kilroy-Silk had made him deputy party leader of Veritas, Latin for truth.
