MPs and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats.
Tony Blair has argued.
"What could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our Parliament?"
"We believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny," said co-ordinator Peter Facey.
"In lieu of any other such clear proposals, the government must permit that to happen."
But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a "large majority".
there needs to be consensus on reforms.
The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords.
