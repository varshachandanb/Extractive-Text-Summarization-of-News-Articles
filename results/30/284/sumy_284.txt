Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.In his 22 years in the Commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the UK's political and electoral system.And his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the Lib Dems as the "real" opposition.And they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary Britain".He insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over £100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum.He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour."I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election," he said.That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.
