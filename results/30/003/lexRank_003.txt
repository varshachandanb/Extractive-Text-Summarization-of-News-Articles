The minister told delegates that getting rid of "career sexism" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.
Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures.
"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential.
Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment.
And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.
Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid.
Ms Hewitt told the seminar: "Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months.
The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.
