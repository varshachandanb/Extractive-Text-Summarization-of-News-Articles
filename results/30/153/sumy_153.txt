New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday.Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May.Mr Clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants.But he rejected the Tories' call for a quota on economic migrants, saying no "arbitrary figure" could reflect the UK's needs.Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject the Tories' idea of quotas on asylum.
