UK plan to deport terror suspects  Deals are being sought to allow the UK to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.
Home Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached.
The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful.
The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan.
The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.
Mr Clarke told The Times: "I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come."
