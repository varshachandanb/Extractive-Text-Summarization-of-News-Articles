Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled.In a statement, Lord Goldsmith said: "I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer."He added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the PM.Lord Goldsmith said Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan played no part in drafting the answer."The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did," he said."If his original advice of 7 March accepted that military action might be illegal, how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the Parliamentary answer was published on 17 March?"Earlier, Tony Blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a "fair summary" of his opinion.he said."The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."
