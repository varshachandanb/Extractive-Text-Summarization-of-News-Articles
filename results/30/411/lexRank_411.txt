Howard's unfinished business  "He's not finished yet," whispered the Conservative Party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall.
And indeed he wasn't.
Michael Howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in Brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to Peter Hain's description of him as an "attack mongrel", claiming such personal abuse meant Labour was "rattled" by the Tory challenge.
And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.
"One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, 'I was there.
I did my bit.
I played my part.
I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better'."
The speech, which was peppered with references to Mr Howard's humble beginnings as the "child of immigrants", had been introduced by his son Nick, a trainee vicar, who praised his father's honesty.
