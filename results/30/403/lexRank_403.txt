Voters 'don't trust politicians'  Eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the BBC suggests.
And 87% of the 1,000 adults quizzed by ICM for BBC News 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised.
Both the Tories and the Lib Dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in Tony Blair, following his claims over Iraqi weapons.
She said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted, but suggested the "three-cornered relationship" between the press, politicians and the public had a hand in the issue.
The poll comes after Foreign Secretary Jack Straw predicted trust would be "the key choice" at the next election.
But according to the BBC poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 May.
Some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections, while 92% said they never gave "a straight answer".
