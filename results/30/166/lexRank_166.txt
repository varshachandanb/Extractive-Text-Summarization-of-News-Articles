The home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life, but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility.
The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinn's nanny.
Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story.
"I haven't spoken about it and I don't intend to.
The allegations, which he has denied, are being investigated by Sir Alan Budd.
Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job.
