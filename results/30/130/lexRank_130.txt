Blair told to double overseas aid  Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.
Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price.
Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a "scar" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.
It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.
Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty.
"As rich countries get richer, they're giving less and less.
This scandal must stop," Oxfam's Barbara Stocking said.
