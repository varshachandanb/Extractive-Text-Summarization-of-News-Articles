Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was "fundamentally flawed" and did not follow the proper consultation process.
HACAN chairman John Stewart said: "Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare.
"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations," a BAA spokesman said.
The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports.
BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities.
Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth.
