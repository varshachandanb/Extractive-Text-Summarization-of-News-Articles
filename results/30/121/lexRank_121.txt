She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant.
Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again," she said.
The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop.
There are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.
This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.
On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.
"We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales.
But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006.
In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months.
