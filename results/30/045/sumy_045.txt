Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest.As an MSP, Mr McLetchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport.BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell said no complaint had been made against Mr McLetchie, but questions were raised about his dual role.Mr McLetchie said: "I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded."He said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at Tods Murray.
