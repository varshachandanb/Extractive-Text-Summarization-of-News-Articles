New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs. Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee. "Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street," he said. "Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes.
