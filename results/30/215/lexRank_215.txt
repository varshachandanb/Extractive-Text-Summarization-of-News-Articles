In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a "significant risk" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were "disproportionate".
New rules tackle 'sham weddings'  New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.
Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were "not proportionate" and "discriminatory".
To get a certificate, costing Â£135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK.
Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.
The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.
Under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the UK only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.
But from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'.
They can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice.
