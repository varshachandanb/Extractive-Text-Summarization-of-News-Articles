First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.Ms Brankin said: "The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this."Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out.The Scottish National Party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers."This is not an attempt to apportion blame, but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases."BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation.He said: "We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs.The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor "in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers"."They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision."Ferguson, who slashed a man in a doctors' surgery in Coatbridge in 1994, had been out to see his fianc&#233;e Annabella Holmes, 47, whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in South Lanarkshire.
