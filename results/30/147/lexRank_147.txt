London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny.
The prime minister told MPs: "The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall."
He told BBC Radio: "If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."
Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack.
Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration.
But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score "cheap political points" by muddling immigration with asylum.
"That's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country," he said.
