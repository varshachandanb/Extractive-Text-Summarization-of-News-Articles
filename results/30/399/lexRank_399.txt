The news comes despite Mr Flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate.
He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening.
At a news conference, Mr Howard insisted he had played by the party's rules.
But the local Tory chairman made similar comments on Friday and dissent continues.
Russell Tanguay, agent for Arundel and South Downs Tories, said Mr Flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute.
He quit as Tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the Tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an MP.
Labour election campaign coordinator Alan Milburn said the Tories were in "turmoil" because Mr Flight had exposed their hidden plans.
Mr Hilton on Tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal.
"The association is in the process of selecting a new candidate."
