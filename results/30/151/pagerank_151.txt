Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK.But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was "absolutely" inadmissible in UK courts.But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station.Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug.Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was "a hero".Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them.In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers.
