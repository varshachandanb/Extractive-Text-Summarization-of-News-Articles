Lib Dems unveil women's manifesto  The Liberal Democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.
Mr Kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing "illiberal" ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too.
The Labour party has committed itself to "universal, affordable and flexible" childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm.
They were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.
He says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children.
The Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues.
The policies are not new announcements, but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.
Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party's candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women.
