Charles Kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments.The Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues.Mr Kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing "illiberal" ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too.Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party's candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women.Mr Kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour on Monday.During the interview Mr Kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party's general election campaign around the birth of his first child, which is expected in April.Party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success.In September, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if Labour won a third term.
