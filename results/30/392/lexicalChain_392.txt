The chancellor, speaking during a week-long tour of Africa, said it was time to talk about enduring British values of liberty and tolerance. BBC political correspondent Mark Mardell said Britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor's but "never before has he been so outspoken in defending Britain's past history". On top of the relief deal with Tanzania Mr Brown said the UK would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line. Former international development secretary Clare Short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.
