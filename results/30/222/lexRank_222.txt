Voters 'reject EU by two to one'  British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.
The Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour.
However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow.
Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution.
Another 7% said they would not vote at all.
