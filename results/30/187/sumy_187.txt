Tessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a "humiliating retreat" by the Tories.It puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the government's Gambling Bill.The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.But Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a "shambles".Ms Jowell's deputy, Richard Caborn, said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue, and responded to the concerns raised.Salvation Army spokesman Jonathan Lomax said: "The proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period, which we think should last at least five years, will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling."
