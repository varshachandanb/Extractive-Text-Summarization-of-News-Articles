The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced.- The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.He said: "We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment.""Sustainable communities" were being promoted without a real understanding of what "sustainable" means, the Environmental Audit Committee said.The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low.
