"We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour. "I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision. Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.The government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma.
