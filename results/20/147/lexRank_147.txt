London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny.
The prime minister told MPs: "The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall."
He told BBC Radio: "If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."
Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack.
Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration.
