Howard and Blair tax pledge clash  Tony Blair has said voters will have to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.
The Liberal Democrats have also launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the "authentic opposition", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees.
The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget.
