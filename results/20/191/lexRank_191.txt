Short attacks US over tsunami aid  Former Cabinet minister Clare Short has criticised the US-led tsunami aid coalition, saying the UN should be leading efforts.
President Bush has announced that an alliance of the US, India, Australia and Japan will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive.
But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN.
