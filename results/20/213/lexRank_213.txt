Labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to Â£3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to Â£3,000.
"They are committed to abandoning Labour's targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under Lib Dem plans students would even have to study near home."
They say the Lib Dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the "goodwill" of the chancellor.
Lib Dems target the student vote  Students can decide the fate of MPs in some seats at the next election, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has claimed.
Mr Kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the Iraq war, which his party opposed, as a defining issue.
