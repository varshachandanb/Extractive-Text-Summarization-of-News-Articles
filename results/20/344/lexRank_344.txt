So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor.
And that is where one of the problems lies for Mr Howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services AND lower taxes?
This was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to.
Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked Â£4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how.
"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less," he said.
