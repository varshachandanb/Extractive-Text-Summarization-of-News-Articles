The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work."While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible," says its report.Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200.Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: "There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
