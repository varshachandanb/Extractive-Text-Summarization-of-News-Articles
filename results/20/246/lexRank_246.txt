The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.
The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.
The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.
He told BBC News: "We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well.
He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.
