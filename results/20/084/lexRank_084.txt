Job cuts 'false economy'  - TUC  Plans to shed 71,000 civil service jobs will prove to be a "false economy" that could hamper public sector reforms, according to a TUC report.
Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 November.
The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the Â£22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms.
