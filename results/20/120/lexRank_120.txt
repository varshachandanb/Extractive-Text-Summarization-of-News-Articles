Number 10 said an error was made but now Harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace.
A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: "Harry the Nazi."
Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident.
Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take.
