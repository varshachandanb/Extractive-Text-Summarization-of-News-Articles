All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003.But he added: "Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. But he said there were still "serious questions" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. She said: "They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. Civil rights group Liberty said it was "delighted" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.
