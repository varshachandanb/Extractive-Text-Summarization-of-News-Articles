EU fraud clampdown urged  EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.
A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting.
The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud.
It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts.
