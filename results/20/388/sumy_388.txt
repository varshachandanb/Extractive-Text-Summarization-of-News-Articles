Monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in England is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency.The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been "disappointing".They also want to set up a new "half-way house" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that "individual budget".But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice."After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision," said Mr Burns.Health spokesman Paul Burstow said: "Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.
