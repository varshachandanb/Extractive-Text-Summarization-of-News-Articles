An inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the Pakistani president's visit to London were found by a member of the public. "We cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents, only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit," said the spokesman. The force's Directorate of Professional Standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents, he said.
