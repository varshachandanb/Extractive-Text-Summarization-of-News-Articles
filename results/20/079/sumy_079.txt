The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws.Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check.Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover.
