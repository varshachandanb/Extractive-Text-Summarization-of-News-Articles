Kennedy begins pre-election tour  Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the "real opposition".
On Tuesday Mr Kennedy will visit Leicester South, where Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill overturned a big Labour majority to win the seat in last year's by-election.
Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in "recent experience".
But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in "by the back door".
