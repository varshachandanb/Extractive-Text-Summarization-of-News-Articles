Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.
Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55.
A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study.
