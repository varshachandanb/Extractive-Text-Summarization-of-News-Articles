Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them."If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned," said Mr Jones."When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not," he said.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again.
