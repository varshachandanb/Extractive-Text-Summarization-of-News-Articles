Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing "cold calls". Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. "If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned," said Mr Jones. "If a party rings a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
