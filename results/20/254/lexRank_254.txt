Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.
And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip.

For his part, Mr Brown insists his only motivation was to get Labour re-elected.
