Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain. They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.Mr Blair talked about the "New" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label. One only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief Charlie Whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound Mr Brown's leadership ambitions. Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media-only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation.
