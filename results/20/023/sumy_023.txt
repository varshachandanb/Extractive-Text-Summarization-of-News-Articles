A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a "disgraceful waste" by MPs.With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had "too much freedom to spend public money as it wished", the report found."The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme."The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but "should learn the lessons from this disaster".
